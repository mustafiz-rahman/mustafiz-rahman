### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Md Mostafizur Rahman

I am a full-stack software engineer with experience in large-scale web applications and back-end systems, using a variety of coding languages, frameworks, and technologies. I am self-motivated and passionate about programming, from designing system architecture to diving deep into frameworks and problem solving.

In my spare time, I am mostly adding new skills to my repertoire and sometimes open-sourcing.
